# MAT
### Macrophage Anlaysis Toolkit

## Setup
1. Python 3 will need to be installed prior to seting up MAT. Python 3 can be 
    downloaded from python.org, or installed via your package manager in linux. 
    If it is installed correctly opening a terminal(cmd/powershell in windows)
    and typing python (in some distributions such as Ubuntu the command is 
    python3) should start a python prompt.
2. From a terminal window navigate to the folder where MAT has been downloaded. 
    From there run the setup.py to ensure all dependancies are installed. Run
    with the command `python setup.py install`. Alternatively install these 
    dependancies: matplotlib, scipy, scikit-image, scikit-learn, xlrd, xlsxwriter,
    numpy, PyQt5, PIL.
3. To run MAT either use the command `python 'Macrophage Analysis Toolkit.py'` or
    double-click on *Macrophage Analysis Toolkit.py* from the file explorer.
